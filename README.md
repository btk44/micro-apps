# micro-apps
Set of micro apps that can be useful when building something bigger ;)

The project will contain:
* docker compose files for each service
* account service - for creating accounts and indentity providing
* user service - for managing users under one account
* to be continued

All the services are done using C#, .Net, SQLServer, Docker. 
UI - if will be done here - will be made with Vue probably.
